Got it! Now, instead of using **Activity ID** as the cache key, we're using **Account Number**. The updated cache key format is:  

### **Updated Cache Key Format**  
```plaintext
CacheKey: "Acct-{AccountNumber}_Page_{PageNumber}"
```
**Example:**  
For **Account Number = 1000002022**, and **Page 1**, the cache key will be:  
```plaintext
CacheKey: "Acct-1000002022_Page_1"
```

---

### **Updated Caching Scenarios:**

#### **Scenario 1: First-time API Call**
- User requests data for **Account Number: 1000002022**, **Page 1**.
- Cache key **"Acct-1000002022_Page_1"** is checked.
- **Cache Miss** â†’ Backend API call is made.
- Response is stored in the cache with a **TTL (Time-To-Live) of 5 minutes**.

---

#### **Scenario 2: User Moves to Page 2, Page 3, etc.**
- User navigates to **Page 2**.
- Cache key **"Acct-1000002022_Page_2"** is checked.
- **Cache Miss** â†’ Backend API call is made, and the response is cached.
- User navigates to **Page 3**, **Page 4**â€¦ Same process repeats.

---

#### **Scenario 3: User Changes Filters (Payload Changes)**
- User changes **date filters** or any other request parameter.
- Since the payload has changed, **all cache entries for the account number should be cleared**:
  ```plaintext
  CacheKey: "Acct-1000002022_Page_1" â†’ Cleared
  CacheKey: "Acct-1000002022_Page_2" â†’ Cleared
  CacheKey: "Acct-1000002022_Page_3" â†’ Cleared
  ```
- **Backend API call is made again** for Page 1 and fresh data is cached.

---

#### **Scenario 4: User Goes Back to Page 1 After Visiting Other Pages**
- If the cache entry **"Acct-1000002022_Page_1"** still exists within **5 minutes**, the cached data is served.
- **If the cache has expired**, a new backend API call is made, and fresh data is cached.

---

#### **Scenario 5: User Exits ActivityDetails and Returns Later**
- If the user exits **ActivityDetails** and comes back later:
  - **All cache related to the account number should be cleared** to ensure fresh data is loaded.
  - When the user reopens **Page 1**, a **backend call is made** and new data is cached.

---

### **Cache Management Summary**
| **Scenario** | **Cache Action** |
|-------------|----------------|
| First-time API call | Fetch from backend, store in cache. |
| User moves between pages | Serve from cache if available, otherwise fetch from backend. |
| Payload change (filters updated) | Clear all cache for the account number, fetch fresh data. |
| User goes back to Page 1 | Serve from cache if within TTL, otherwise fetch fresh data. |
| User exits and returns | Clear all cache for the account number, fetch fresh data. |

---

### **Final Considerations**
- **Cache Invalidation Strategy:**  
  - Cache expires automatically after **5 minutes** (TTL).  
  - Cache is **cleared immediately** when the payload changes or user exits the activity.  
- **Improved Performance:**  
  - Cached data reduces backend calls for repeated page requests within the TTL.  
  - Ensures fresh data is loaded when necessary by clearing outdated cache entries.
